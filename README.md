We are aiming to create a system that monitors the user's current emotional state, along with the time of day and adjusts the ambient lighting to reduce/control stress and anxiety.

We aim to do this by monitoring the user's eye movements using tools such as:
- Tobii Pro Glasses 2
- Microsoft HoloLens 2
- Philips Hue (Ambient Light)
 

More details will be provided in due course
